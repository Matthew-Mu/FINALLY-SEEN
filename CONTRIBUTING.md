## WELCOME AND THANKS FOR CONTRIBUTING

### First things first:

- We do use Github API to pull some stats including your profile picture if you're on the list of top 8 contributors. IF YOU'RE NOT OKAY WITH THAT, Please do not contribute =) or don't be top 8.

- Your initial contribution will be adding your contact to ROSTER.md

- You will find the template and instructions (hint: click raw to view markdown and copy)

- After forking, ensure to ALWAYS PULL DEVELOPMENT, which is the branch all collaboration work will be PRd to.

- NEVER PR TO MAIN, it will not be merged.

- Always work on your branch, naming it camelCase with your first and last name

> Ex: arysePagano

### Issues

- There will be PLENTY of issues for you to choose from. If you see one that fits you, comment on it to be assigned to it.

- Please be aware that we will all be waiting on your piece of work. The easiest way to get CONFLICTS is by delivering outdated/late work.

- Be respectful and deliver within 24 hrs. Those issues will be short enough for that to be accomplished very easily.

- If you run into problems, DO comment on your task. Other people and myself will gladly give a hand.

- I intend to open GITHUB PROJECTS for this app. To be announced in the near future. For now, well organized issues will do the job.

### Clone the repository

- Fork the repository.

- Clone the forked repository.

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/your_username/FINALLY-SEEN.git
  ```

- Clone all the branches from the parent repository, not only main branch.

### Creating a branch

- When starting work on a new issue, branch off from the `development` branch.

  ```bash
  $ git checkout -b <branch-name> development
  ```

- Switched to a new branch "<branch-name>".

- Contributors working on same issue but in different branches can do sub-team fetches in case required.

- Commit the changes with some descriptive messgaes.

  ```bash
  $ git commit -m "<commit message>"
  ```

- Once the issue is finished, the contributor shall push the changes to remote after commiting.
  ```bash
  $ git push origin <branch-name>
  ```

### Raising a Pull request

- Once the branch has been pushed, the contributor shall raise the PR against the `development`.

- Contributor shall incorporate review comments and upon approval, the PR shall proceed for merge into `development`.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
